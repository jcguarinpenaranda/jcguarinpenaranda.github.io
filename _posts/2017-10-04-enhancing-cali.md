I was born in Cali, Colombia. It is my city, the city in which I have lived almost all my life with my family; the city in which I have made great friends; in which I went to the university and a city in which I have lots and lots of souvenirs. From my childhood to this point, this city has been the environment in which I have grown.

Now, I find it very beautiful to think what would I do if I had to change something? what would it be? I get to this point thinking that there's always an opportunity to propose alternatives, to enhance the place in which one lives. Maybe this is not the true solution to the large amount of situations that this city witnesses day by day, but here's my grain of sand; here's my personal opinion and proposal.

## Becoming more touristic

For me, one of the best things that could happen to a city is to become touristic. In this way, many people come and new sectors are developed. To be touristic, the city must face violence and propose new leisure places, new events, get in shape to be [walkable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKOB-d3uds) and be able to receive tourists from all around the world with all their languages.

Tourists come from cities in which most of these proposals are already implemented. Big cities like Barcelona, Madrid or St. Petersburg already have most of these solutions working and there's no surprise on why they receive lots of tourists each year.

## Underground cables

In most european cities, the electricity and telecommunications cables go underground. This really clears the view and makes the city look beautiful. For instance, take look at this picture:

And now, take a look at it without cables. Much better, huh?

Please note that I also editted the street platforms and demarcation to be more friendly. With these little changes, all of a sudden, the city feels better and is more adequate for receiving tourists.
