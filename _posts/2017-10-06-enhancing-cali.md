title: What would I do to enhance Cali? (part 2)

Continuing with part 2 of this series, I want to propose another big idea to enhance Cali, my city.

## Metro System

All big cities have a metro system, and once I had the opportunity to travel I started wondering why. In Cali we have a *massive* transportation system called MIO, but very soon it became a bottleneck for the city. There are lots of people that use this system daily, and sometimes one must wait around 30 to 40 minutes to grab a space in a bus.

### The current state

This is a very personal opinion but I think it makes a lot of sense. While in other cities the transportation goes underground with a metro that has around 10 wagons, in Cali we have a system that shares the ground space with other cars and buses and has to stop on each intersection. Going underground means that there are no red lights, and that there is a whole new space to keep growing the system. Here is a picture of the MIO system we have in Cali:

As you can see, the system has double buses that transport the people. They transit on private lanes that are borrowed from the public lanes that once were a public street. In this system, the stations receive buses that go to very different destinations, which means that depending on the bus you take, you can go to a different part of the city. 

In the metro system you know that there are some stations that intersect different lines of the metro, so you can easily switch directions if you need to, but in the MIO or Transmilenio systems, almost all the stations receive buses that go to different places, which leads to this problem:

The problem is that not only some stations are very small (because there's not enough space at ground level), but they have to share different destinations, which also makes a big queue of buses waiting to pick up the passengers. Also, as there are different destinations, lots of people arrive to a single station and then everything collapses:

### The problem goes bigger

As the system collapses, people try to find other solutions to move around the city like buying more cars or motorbikes, but this means that we have more and more traffic. Even the [Pico y Placa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_y_placa), a measure first invented in Bogotá and then applied in Cali to stop the circulation of cars based on their plate number is insufficient to face the demand of people willing to pay more just to have a way to move around the city.

So, we get to a situation in which at peak hours, the city becomes impossible. As you have seen, the public transportation system collapses, but also the streets collapse due to the large amount of cars:

... and the large amount of motorbikes:

Then, rinse and repeat every single day from almost 6 to 8 am and from 5 to 7 pm. That's the magnitude of it.

### A solution

I know I have criticized the current state, by exposing the not so beautiful effects on the city public and private transportation, but I wanted to get to this point, in which you ask yourself what would be a solution, then? Well, my proposal is nothing different than a system that was invented more than a hundred years ago in London: The metro.

Above is a picture of the metro in Paris, with its own underground lane and lots of wagons to transport people. Oh, and the waiting time? R/Around 5 to 10 minutes. Of course, not only this kind of system would releive us in the peak hours of the traffic in the city, but also would bring the following benefits:

* Arriving faster to any destination
* Waiting less, as the system is able to move more people in one take 
* Less pollution (as we could have electric trains, instead of Diesel buses)
* Less stress
* Higher life quality
* The city becomes more productive
