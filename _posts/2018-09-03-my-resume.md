![Hello](/assets/images/me.jpg)
*Enjoying St. Petersburg :) - `2018`*

My name is Juan Camilo Guarín Peñaranda. I am 24 years old and I am a graduate student from the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente in Cali - Colombia. Now, I am a Multimedial Engineer and I had a scholarship through all my career called “Premio a la Excelencia Académica” (Prize to the Academic Excellence) from the university, given to people who had more than 4.0 or 4.5 out of 5 as a grade in the total semester score. 

I like studying a lot and [I was ranked 6th](/assets/pdf/icfes-results.pdf) out of a thousand students of Colombia in 2011 in the ICFES tests. [I was listed as one of the best students in Colombia in 2015 in the Saber Pro](/assets/pdf/saber-pro-certificate.pdf).

I am very curious about entrepreneurship, helping people, web apps, mobile apps, videogames and internet of things. I also like the 3D modelling and 3D animation, but what I like the most from what I have learned at the university is to use the tools I learned to understand different branches of the knowledge, like electronics, informatics, telematics, user centered design and others. For me, it is not only to understand, but to connect all that knowledge to bring to life solutions that help people and solve problems.
