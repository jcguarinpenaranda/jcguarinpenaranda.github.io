I have always wanted to have a way to communicate the world what I am up to, and I think I have found the perfect solution: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

So far it has been a lot of fun playing with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and picking one of the [available themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) I found. So far, I have written several blog posts as well as hosted [My CV](/cv), and will try to keep posting and adding more information as I learn more and more. I like being able to edit posts as files and making changes that are reflected in my website.

## The future

I plan adding more and more content to this personal blog, related to `programming`, `javascript` and more things that I am passionate about.
